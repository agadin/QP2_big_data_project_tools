    "# Location Finder\n",
    "An excited new technology in the field of image datascience and radiology is the use of machine learning to locate and idenpngy specific structures in medical images in 3D space. This technology can be used to assist radiologists in diagnosing diseases and conditions, as well as to help researchers analyze large volumes of medical image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this technology is the nnU-Net framework (linke to their nature publication: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01008-z), which is a deep learning model for medical image segmentation. This model can be used to locate and idenpngy different organs in medical images in 3D space. In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use a nnU-Net model trained across 120 abdomen CT and 40 MRI scans to locate and idenpngy structures in your image stack from either image technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the model will be a prediction on the location of the structures in the image stack. The prediction will be in the form of a description that describes the location of the structures in the image stack. The prediction will be displayed in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the process of downloading the required files, uploading your image stack, formating your uploaded image stack and running the model to generate a prediction. To get started, run the cells below and follow the instructions."
