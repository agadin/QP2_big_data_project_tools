# Introduction

## `visualize_3D_solid.ipynb`
A simple 3D object viewer using plotly. The input is a singlefolder containing a stack of `.tif` images. The output is a 3D object viewer that can be rotated and zoomed in and out. 

## `surrace_classifier.ipynb`
The Surface Classifier tool analyzes 3D image stacks to quantify surface characteristics, providing surface statistics and exporting a 3D mesh (`.obj` file) for further insights or 3D printing.

# Installation
Each tool is designed to be run in its own jupyter notebook. Run all cells in the notebook in order to use the tool.
