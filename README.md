# Introduction

## `visualize_3D_solid.py`
A simple 3D object viewer using plotly. The input is a singlefolder containing a stack of `.tif` images. The output is a 3D object viewer that can be rotated and zoomed in and out. 


# Installation
Each tool is designed to be run in its own jupyter notebook. At the start of the notebook the necessary libraries are imported using the `.txt` file with the same name as the notebook/python file.
